        <p>Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, is a vibrant nation known for its diverse cultures, languages, and religions. 
            Located in West Africa, it boasts a rich history, having gained independence from British rule in 1960. 
            Nigeria is a federation of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, with a dynamic economy driven by oil production and a growing non-oil sector. 
            The country faces numerous challenges, including security threats like insurgency and banditry, as well as economic and social inequalities. 
            Despite these challenges, Nigeria remains a key player in Africa, with significant economic and political influence. </p>
